{"title": "Pristine Paradise Palau - \u201cIn Palau, women play a very important role in issues of policy. Women traditionally own and devise land. We control the clan money. We traditionally select our chiefs; women place and remove them. Having observed their upbringing closely, we are able to decide which men have the talent to represent our interests. From birth, Palauan women are responsible for the men. When men marry, the women arrange for the settlement, and when they die, women bury them. Women are caretakers of the environment\u201d -Mirair Gabriela Ngirmang in the book, 1000 Women for the Nobel Peace Prize 2005.   Palauan culture, in former times and still to this day, practices a matriarchal society, where women is of higher status than men. Palau is truly unique!
