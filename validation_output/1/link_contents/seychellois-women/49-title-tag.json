{"title": "Today in Seychelles - Society  Where are the men?  In the first quarter of 2015, government employed 5 978 Seychellois women compared to 2 961 men. This appears to confirm the trend which shows girls consistently outperforming boys academically, to the point where, after five years, the University of Seychelles has only just produced its first male graduate with honours.   P. Mawanda  On Thursday, a lone young man posed for a group photo with four fellow colleagues at State House, following a meeting with the President. This young man achieved the feat last year of becaming the University of Seychelles\u2019 (UniSey) only male student who graduated with honours (See page 2 for more on this).  While in most countries, girls outdo boys in terms of academic performance as a general rule, the situation is rarely as extreme as this one. Until 2015, all those who graduated from UniSey with an honours degree have been women. Siddhanth Mathur who is aware that he has broken a record, told TODAY that \"these days, it\u2019s hard to see young men studying hard.\u201d   Is it because Seychellois girls are better suited to hard work or because more girls choose to enroll into tertiary institutions?   Amanda Rene, another honours graduate, says that she does not know why girls outperform boys although she thinks it might have to do with the fact that \"it is because girls are more committed to studying and are self disciplined. When I was beginning my business course, I knew that I had no other option but to work hard and pass. I was studying on a government bond and, one way or another, I had to pass. I could not do anything but pass, so I worked hard,\u201d she said.  But the same facilities are available to boys with free education, from cr\u00e8che to secondary school to centres of further learning such as the vocational school.  For students such as Ms. Rene who want to go to university, government steps in yet again and offers educational loans. According to the CIA\u2019s World Factbook, almost 92% of the population is estimated to be literate, with male literacy standing at 91.4% and female literacy standing at 92.3%. With such figures, the number of males who successfully finish school should be as high as that of females.   Speaking to TODAY, a secondary school teacher from Pointe Larue said that the reason more females successfully complete their studies is because of the role they have to play in society. \u201cWe live in a society where girls see their mothers work hard to support their families. The responsibility of putting food on the dinner table mostly lies on the shoulders of women. So these girls grow up with this kind of mentality. The boys on the other hand often grow up seeing the men in their lives doing nothing but drink and fish. They have the mentality that studying is meant for girls and not for them. This alone makes teaching girls easier than teaching boys. I will not lie and say that all the girls in any given classroom are interested in studying. Some are not. But on the whole, the girls in all the classes that I teach make better students than boys. They are more interested in learning compared to their male counterparts. They have no other option than to study and work hard if they want to provide for their families or reduce their mother\u2019s burden,\u201d he said.  And it follows that more women are in employment. In the first quarter of 2015, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), government employed 5 978 Seychellois women and only 2 961 men. The trend of having more women employees compared to men is not any different in the private sector. A human resource manager in a private company cited proper qualifications as the cause of this: \u201c90% of our staff is made up of women and I believe this is the same almost everywhere in the country. And I think the reason most companies employ more women is because, most of the time, women tend to be more qualified than men. Also, women tend to take their work more seriously than men. They show up on time and can work in almost any environment\u201d.  The HR manager was however quick to point out that it also depends on the nature of the job. According to her, in some male dominated fields, like engineering and information technology, the number of male employees is higher than the number of women employees. But even this may not be for long as more and more females seem to be developing an interest in these \"male dominated\" fields. In 2015, more than three girls graduated in engineering and Information technology from the University of Seychelles.  Inset  A history of hard working women   In an anthropological study published by Sandra J.T.M. Evers in 2010 entitled \u201cTales from a Captive Audience: Dissident Narratives and the Official History of the Seychelles\u201d, the author recognises that Seychellois women have traditionally been the ones to bear the family burden because of the fact that most children are born out of wedlock.   \"Women assist each other in caring for their children. On Sundays, they go with their children and female friends to the beach, or attend church. According to our interviews, fathers play a minor role in the rearing of their children or providing for them. The men circulate in groups, largely keeping to each other, drinking and playing dominos. Women often worked several jobs to make ends meet. In the life histories of women, relationships with men were described as fleeting and unsatisfactory. Janine, 31 years of age, expressed a typical opinion: \u2018The men here in the Seychelles are good for nothing. All they can do is drink'\". | Facebook", "url": "https://m.facebook.com/todayinsey/posts/931739080197236"}
